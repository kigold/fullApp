# Project Title

This is a full stack application that can be used to maintain and track virtual football competition between friends a colleagues.
The idea is to be able to keep track of games played between friends for record purposes, it can serve as a way to keep score,
and also tournaments can also be set up and tracked.

The application comprises of a Frontend application built using Javascript -> Vue Js, and the Backend application using Python -> Django.
The Database is PostgreSQL.

We propose to also implement a mobile application using Flutter

## Getting Started

First step is to download the code.

### Prerequisites

The application can be run on windows or linux or mac os.

For the frontend, you need to have Node js installed.

CD into the web directory and run the commands below

```
npm serve
```

For the backend, you need to have python installed, and also PostgreSQL must be installed on the computer or server.

CD into the api directory and run the commands below

```
source env/bin//activate
python manage.py runserver
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
